# nodemon

Restart the development server right after saving a file.

## Installation 

**npm**
```npm install nodemon -D```

**yarn**

```yarn add nodemon -D```

After doing that, you can start the project using the command  `nodemon <./filePath.js>`  and everytime you save the file nodemon will take care of the execution.

> Tip: Create a new script on package.json with the nodemon start command.
